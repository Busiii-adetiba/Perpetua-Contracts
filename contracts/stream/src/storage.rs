//! Storage access and TTL management.
//!
//! # Why TTL is the hard part
//!
//! Soroban persistent entries have a time-to-live measured in ledgers. When it
//! runs out the entry is archived and becomes unreadable until explicitly
//! restored. A stream running twelve months will outlive its default TTL.
//!
//! If a stream entry archives the tokens are *not* lost — they sit in the
//! contract's pooled balance — but the accounting entry saying who they belong to
//! is inaccessible until someone pays to restore it. For a payroll or grant
//! primitive that is unacceptable, so the contract engineers around it three
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. **Extend on every touch.** Every function that reads or writes a stream
//!    bumps that entry's TTL. An actively-used stream never expires.
//! 2. **Extend generously at creation**, targeting the stream's remaining
//!    lifetime plus a buffer, clamped to the network maximum.
//! 3. **Permissionless top-ups** via `extend_stream_ttl`, so a keeper —or the
//!    recipient, or any passer-by — can keep a claim readable without the
//!    sender's cooperation.
//!
//! # Instance vs persistent TTL policy
//!
//! The contract uses two Soroban storage lifetimes, and they are *not* managed
//! the same way:
//!
//! | Entry | Lifetime | TTL target | Who bumps it |
//! |-------|----------|-----------|--------------|
//! | [`DataKey::NextStreamId`] (id counter) | **instance** | always the network `max_ttl()` | every mutating call |
//! | [`DataKey::Stream(id)`] (a stream) | **persistent** | remaining life + [`TTL_BUFFER_SECONDS`], floored at [`MIN_STREAM_TTL_LEDGERS`] | every touch + keeper |
//!
//! **Instance entries are always kept at maximum rent.** They are tiny, and the
//! id counter carries the contract's monotonicity invariant: if `NextStreamId`
//! archived, the next `create_stream` would restart ids from zero and collide
//! with live streams. So [`extend_instance`] pins it to `max_ttl()` on *every*
//! mutating call — creation, every withdrawal, every pause, every keeper sweep.
//!
//! **Persistent entries target the stream's remaining lifetime.** They hold the
//! full accounting record, so they are extended to a window that covers the
//! stream's scheduled end plus a keeper buffer. A stream that is still settling
//! keeps a floor of [`MIN_STREAM_TTL_LEDGERS`] so final state stays readable.
//!
//! **Ordering guarantee.** [`DataKey::NextStreamId`] must *never* expire before
//! the streams it issued. Because the instance entry is always pinned to the
//! maximum while a persistent entry is only ever as long-lived as its target,
//! the instance entry is always at least as fresh as any stream — so a live
//! stream can never outlive its own id-counter, and a keeper sweep always
//! bumps both in the same transaction ([`extend_stream_ttl`] calls
//! [`extend_stream`] *and* [`extend_instance`] together).
//!
//! # Safe handling of each storage type
//!
//! - **Instance `NextStreamId`** is read with a fallback of `0` (a fresh
//!   contract), written monotonically, and always re-extended. A restored
//!   instance correctly resumes from the last persisted id, never reusing one.
//! - **Persistent `Stream(id)`** is read through [`load_stream`] (which bumps
//!   TTL) or [`peek_stream`] (view-only, no write). [`stream_exists`] reports
//!   `false` for an archived entry, which combined with the id counter lets the
//!   contract tell "never existed" apart from "needs restoring".
//!
//! The regression tests in `test/ttl.rs` exercise both lifetimes from seeded
//! ledger states and assert that the instance entry cannot expire before the
//! persistent entries it issued.
